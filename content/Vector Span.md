## Function Definition

Input: a set of vectors
Output: a set of vectors

$S=\set{\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},...,\vec{v_n}}$, vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$
$\Rightarrow\mathrm{span}{(S)}$ is the set of all vectors which can be made from a [[Linear Combination|linear combination]] of the vectors in $S$.

_Note: the [[Zero Vector|zero vector]] is always in the span of any set_

## Properties

$\mathrm{span}{(S)}$ is a $k$ dimensional [[Subspace of Rn|subspace]] where $k$ is the largest [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]] subset of $S$
